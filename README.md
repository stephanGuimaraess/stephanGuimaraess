👋 Hi, I’m Stephan!

🚀 Passionate developer focused on system architecture, clean code, and modern web technologies.

💻 My daily work revolves around JavaScript/TypeScript, building backends with NestJS and frontends with Next.js, always aiming for scalable and secure solutions.

🔐 Experienced with authentication and authorization using Keycloak, messaging with RabbitMQ, caching/distribution with Redis, and relational databases like PostgreSQL.

🛠️ Also exploring DevOps and cloud practices to understand the full lifecycle of applications — from idea to production.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially within the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, sharing knowledge and learning from the community.
